# PrepAI: The AI Tutor That Never Sleeps

Standardized tests like WAEC, JAMB, and GCE are the gateways to higher education in West Africa, yet most students rely on static, outdated textbooks. **PrepAI** is a dynamic study companion that brings the power of artificial intelligence to exam preparation. It doesn't just ask questions; it teaches, analyzes, and adapts to the student's performance in real-time.

## The Problem & Solution

Students often study "hard" but not "smart," wasting time on topics they already know while ignoring their blind spots. PrepAI solves this with data.

- **Intelligent Weakness Detection**: By analyzing user answers, the system builds a "knowledge profile" for each student. If a student consistently fails Algebra questions, the AI automatically serves more Algebra practice until mastery is achieved.
- **Essay Evaluation Engine**: One of the hardest things to self-study is essay writing. PrepAI uses Large Language Models to read student essays and provide instant, graded feedback based on actual marking schemes—something a textbook simply cannot do.
- **Real-World Simulation**: I designed the "Past Paper Simulator" to mimic the actual constraints of exams, including time limits and question formats, building not just knowledge but exam-day stamina.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Quizzes**: Practice sessions that get harder or easier based on your real-time performance.
- **Instant Essay Grading**: Detailed feedback on structure, grammar, and argument strength.
- **Subject Mastery Tracking**: Visual dashboards showing exactly which topics need more attention.

## Why It Works

PrepAI transforms passive reading into active recall. It creates a feedback loop that rapidly accelerates learning, giving students the confidence that they aren't just memorizing—they're understanding.
