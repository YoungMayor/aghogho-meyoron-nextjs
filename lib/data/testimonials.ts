      "By far, Mayor is one of the best people I've met in this tech space and he has pushed me to always do better, he never looks down on anyone, even when he's standing his grounds, he is passionate about his work and never hesitates to lend a helping hand. Mayor has built a niche of trust around himself, and his humbleness is the top of it all",
