    description: >-
      As a Senior Backend Engineer at Glover, a leading Nigerian Fintech, I
      played a pivotal role in optimizing and securing the platform which offers
      services ranging from gift card trading to crypto payments. I led the
      migration of the legacy codebase from Laravel v7 to v12 with zero
      downtime, significantly boosting system performance and maintainability.
      My work focused on high-impact features including a custom login security
      system with anomaly detection, a high-speed rewards distribution engine,
      and a Google OCR-powered gift card validation system utilizing encryption
      for data security. I also architected a comprehensive Brand Ambassador
      dashboard and a fraud-resistant customer reward system, directly
      contributing to increased user engagement and platform trust.
    features:
      - Advanced Login Security & Fraud Detection
      - High-Volume Holiday Rewards System
      - Brand Ambassador Management Dashboard
      - Secure Giftcard OCR Validation
      - Automated Customer Rewards Engine
      - Virtual Card Issuance System
      - Zero-Downtime Infrastructure Upgrade

      when he's standing his grounds, he is passionate about his work and never
